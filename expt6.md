## Theory:
A current mirror is a circuit that copies a reference current (I_REF) to one or more output branches while maintaining a constant current regardless of load variations. The circuit is widely used in analog IC design, particularly in biasing circuits, active loads, and current sources.  
The fundamental concept behind a current mirror is that two matched transistors (MOSFETs) with the same gate-source voltage (V_GS) should conduct the same drain current if they operate in the saturation region.  
For MOSFETs operating in saturation, the drain current is given by:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb3e0505-5b88-4365-a8e0-9ddf5eeb9d01)  
where:
ùúáùëõ= Electron mobility  
ùê∂ùëúùë•= Gate oxide capacitance per unit area  
W/L = Width-to-length ratio of the MOSFET  
VGS = Gate-to-source voltage  
VTH= Threshold voltage  
If two MOSFETs are identical (same W/L ratio and process parameters) and have the same V_GS, they should theoretically conduct the same drain current.

Saturation Condition for MOSFETs:
For an NMOS transistor to be in saturation:
VDS>VGS‚àíVth
‚ÄãVDS=1.54
VGS=0.66
Vth=0.4V  
therefore MOSFET is in saturation.  
For PMOS (M1 & M2):

Saturation Condition:

‚à£ùëâùëÜùê∑‚à£>‚à£ùëâùëÜùê∫‚à£‚àí‚à£ùëâùë°‚Ñé‚à£

ùëâùëÜùê∫=0.53ùëâ,
ùëâùë°‚Ñé=‚àí0.4ùëâ
VSD=1.26V,
VSG=0.53V,
Vth=‚àí0.4V
1.26ùëâ>(0.53ùëâ‚àí(‚àí0.4ùëâ))=0.93ùëâ

Vout max swing(peak to peak) = 1.68V- 0.971V= 0.709V
