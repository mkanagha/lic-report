# Experiment 6
## Aim: 
Design and analyse current mirror circuit as a  active load in amplifier circuit.
## Circit diagram:

## Theory:
A current mirror is a circuit that copies a reference current (I_REF) to one or more output branches while maintaining a constant current regardless of load variations. The circuit is widely used in analog IC design, particularly in biasing circuits, active loads, and current sources.  
The fundamental concept behind a current mirror is that two matched transistors (MOSFETs) with the same gate-source voltage (V_GS) should conduct the same drain current if they operate in the saturation region.  
For MOSFETs operating in saturation, the drain current is given by:
