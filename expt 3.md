#Experiment-3  
#Title: To Design Differential Amplifier  
##Aim : Design and analyse the MOS differential amplifier ckt for the following specifications Vdd=2V, P<=1mW,Vin=1V, Vocm=1.1V,Vp=0.4.  
Perform DC analysis, transient analysis,frequency respose and extract the required parameters.  
#Procedure:   
**Step 1**
DC analysis: Design RSS and Rd.  
Find the q point of the mosefet.
