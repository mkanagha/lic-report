# Experiment-3  
# Title: To Design Differential Amplifier  
## Aim : Design and analyse the MOS differential amplifier ckt for the following specifications Vdd=2V, P<=1mW,Vin=1V, Vocm=1.1V,Vp=0.4.  
Perform DC analysis, transient analysis,frequency respose and extract the required parameters.

## Theory






# Procedure:   
**Step 1**
DC analysis: Design RSS and Rd.  
Find the q point of the mosfet.    
Analysis :  
1)Increase ViCm to 1V and observe Vocm,Vp. justify the results.  
2) Calulate maximum input swing and output swing.  
3) Gain equation using small signal model.  
**Step 2**  
Transient analysis.   
Apply Vin p-p max and verify the o/p, calculate gain if the o/p is linear.  
**Step 3**  
Ac analysis.    
Find te 3dB bandwidth.
